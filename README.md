# Audio-Transformer

Just a small utility to transform my rather large collection of ripped CDs
to an audio format better suited for mobile devices.
I use .flac since it is a lossless compression.

For the actual audio transformation I use the excellent JAVE library from Sauron Software:

Have a look at the JAVE documentation for all the other encoders and decoders
that are supported.
